					Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

                 <h3>It is used for:</h3>
				   <ul>
					<li>Web development</li>
					<li>Software development</li>
					<li>Mathematics</li>
					<li>System scripting</li>
				   </ul>
			    </p>
				<p>
				 <h3>What can Python do?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
						<li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li>
						<li>Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.</li>
						<li>Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.</li>
						<li>Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>	
				<p>
					<h3>Why Python?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
						</li>
						<li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
						</li>
						<li>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
						</li>
						<li>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.</li>
						<li>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>	
				<p>
					<h3>Good to know</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.</li>
						<li>In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Execute Python Syntax</h3>
					Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:
                         <br>
					
						 <code>>> print("Hello, World!")<br>
							Hello, World!
							</code>
							
							<p>Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:<br>
					
							<code>
							C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.py
							</code></p>
				
				</p>

			<header>Variables</header>
			<article>
				<p><h3>Creating Variables</h3>Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.</p>
				<p>A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.<br>
				<code>x = 5
						y = "John"<br>
						print(x)<br>
						print(y)</code>
				</P>
				<p>Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.<br>
					<code>
							x = 4 # x is of type int<br>
							x = "Sally"   # x is now of type str<br>
							print(x)
					</code>
				</p>
				<p><h3>Variable Names</h3>
					A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).<br> Rules for Python variables:
					<ul>
						<li>A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
							</li>
						<li>A variable name cannot start with a number.</li>
						<li>A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )</li>
						<li>Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
								</li>
					</ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="Strings">
			<header>Strings</header>
			<article>
				<p><h3>String Literals</h3>
				<p>String literals in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.</p>
				<p>'hello' is the same as "hello"</p>
				<p>Strings can be output to screen using the print function. For example: print("hello").</p>
                <p>Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters. However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.</p>			
				<h4>Example</h4>Get the character at position 1 (remember that the first character has the position 0):<br>
				<code>
						a = "Hello, World!"<br>
						print(a[1])
				</code>
				<h4>Example</h4>Substring. Get the characters from position 2 to position 5 (not included):<br>
		        <code>b = "Hello, World!"<br>
						print(b[2:5])
						</code>

		<section class="main-section" id="Operators">
			<header>OPerators</header>
			<article>
				<p>Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.</p>
				<p>Python divides the operators in the following groups:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Arithmetic operators</li>
					<li>Assignment operators</li>
					<li>Comparison operators</li>
					<li>Logical operators</li>
					<li>Identity operators</li>
					<li>Membership operators</li>
				    <li>Bitwise operators</li>
				</ul>
